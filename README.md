# CISC5380
Spring 2019 Final Project - Programming with Python

This final project was created with the intention of providing an end user a quick interactive way to play through a dataset with over 694,000 inputs in order to find their optimal dataset for forecasting future flight demand. By design, it is meant for users to create any kind or form of time-based series correlations using any city, region or airline code whether it is origin, destination or a comparison of origion vs destination. It also allows them to sparce the 3 year period based on the kind of trend they would like to analyze (daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly).

In order to make this project work, the downloaded .zip file contains file 'NY_FL_flight_demand.csv' which is necessary in order for 'Project Main.py' to function correctly. 

Please ensure that the .zip is extracted, and both the .csv and the .py files are downloaded onto the same directory.
